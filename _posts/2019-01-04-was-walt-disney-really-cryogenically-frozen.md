Somebody in Bristol started making a vodka called Novichok," said our host, Natasha Ward, faux-scandalised at the reference to the toxic nerve agent. "And they were immediately told, 'Stop it at once!" She laughed as she finished setting the table for the day's gathering in her home in South London, introducing the dishes as one might introduce guests at a party. "We start with herring, salted, not pickled - English people hate beetroot because they've only ever met it in this horrible vinegar, and those rollmop herrings that look like corpses, you know?"
Ward is a master of moving between cultures. She's half-Russian, half-English, and has worked as an interpreter for such diverse parties as the United Nations, Angelina Jolie and Mikhail Gorbachev. Today's task - explaining exactly why Russian people might sniff bread while drinking vodka - may not be quite so starry, but it does offer a portal into the realities of Russian life at a time when sympathetic cultural insight is sorely lacking.
