    title: ThreatSonar is Complementary to Antivirus
    threatsonar:
      a: Performing compromise assessment on APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) risks.
      b: Detecting malicious backdoor, hacking tools, abnormal system configurations.
      c: Mixed dynamic + static engine, built-in indicators + external threat intelligence.
      d: Inspecting memory, file system for unknown threats like just your CSIRT team expert.
      e: Non-residential agent, scan on-demand via task scheduler. Driver-less, minimum performance impact and compatibility issues.
      f: Highlighting potential risky endpoints. Incident Response team can do threat-hunting or clean-up manually.
      g: High efficiency, only scans suspicious locations and intrusion traces. About 20 minutes per endpoint depending on hardware.
    antivirus:
      a: Preventing any kind of malicious program from execution.
      b: Detecting common (non-APT) malware. Such as botnet, worm, banking trojan, or ransomware.
      c: Relying on signature matching which is easy to bypass. Can only detect widely spread known malware.
      d: Unable to triage grey-area risky programs such as abused legitimate VPN tools or new threats.
      e: Residential agent with kernel-mode driver hook often slowing down system performance or causing compatibility issues.
      f: Can block or quarantine infected files, but usually not able to clean-up hidden backdoor automatically.
      g: Full disk scanning always takes up to several hours
