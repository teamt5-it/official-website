        <li>Unable to triage grey-area risky programs such as abused legitimate VPN tools or new threats.</li>
        <li>Residential agent with kernel-mode driver hook often slowing down system performance or causing compatibility issues.</li>

        <li>Non-residential agent, scan on-demand via task scheduler. Driver-less, minimum performance impact and compatibility issues.</li>
        <li>Highlighting potential risky endpoints. Incident Response team can do threat-hunting or clean-up manually.</li>
        <li>High efficiency, only scans suspicious locations and intrusion traces. About 20 minutes per endpoint depending on hardware.</li>
